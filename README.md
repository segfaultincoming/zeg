# Zeg Online

Recreation of the Mu Online game server and an attempt to learn Zig. What could possibly go wrong?

The name (Zeg) is heavily inspired by:
* Zen, the in-game currency of Mu Online
* Zig, you couldn't guessed this one, right?
* And most importantly, the infamous song [Zeg, Zeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ApYJDtSdnA)

## Running the project

Currently you can't run anything. Good luck!

## Planned

- [ ] Server that can get you around Lorencia
- [ ] Fully containerized and distributed environment
- [x] Strong opinions on how to write code
- [x] Segmentation faults here and there

## Thanks

Special thanks to the [OpenMu](https://github.com/MUnique/OpenMU) project. A lot of calculations/packets are referenced from there. The docs are amazing!
